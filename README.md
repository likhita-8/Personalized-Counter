Hi!!

So, this is a playaround basic counter app built using html, css and JS. Runs on your localhost on live server!
For people just starting out, to understand how constants, varibles, functions work for JS to build your muscle memory! So walk around, play with the code, change and customize. Feel free to fork it and make it your own.
